# Welcome to Degradomics analysis in Jupyter Lab

This is a short book, to get you started with analysis of proteomics datasets - specifically, with a focus on degradomics. 


## Intended learning outcomes
By the end of this book you will be able to use JupyterLabs / R to identify proteolytic processing in data processed using MSFragger within Fragpipe {cite}`kong2017fragger`

```{tip}
Other MS analysis pipelines are available, however Fragpipe is the quickest I have tested for semi-specific searching of mass spectrometry data

 How can we find evidence of proteolytic processing here?
 ```

This book shows an example of analyses and plots that can be readily implemented, in order to obtain evidence of proteolytic processing within your data.

```{margin} Did you know?
Proteolytic processing can generate new protein functions, as well as abolishing protein function
```

 From here, we begin biological interpretation of the data

## Caveats
This short book does not go in-depth into generation of the source files used for analysis â€“ check out the Fragpipe manual {cite}`fragpipe_man` for more information. To download FragPipe software, visit {cite}`fragpipe_github`.

```{warning}
Fragpipe requires msconvert from ProteoWizard to process vendor raw data. ProteoWizard does not currently offer Mac (macOS) native support
```

## Dataset used
Our analysis will be applied to a publically available dataset, comparing the proteomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells vs controls {cite}`duncan2021` 

Raw peptide and protein abundances have been log2 transformed by Fragpipe as follows:

```{math}
:label: log2abundance
abundance_{transformed} = log_{2}abundance_{raw}
```

Should non-transformed abundances be required for any other purpose, the following transformation can be applied:
```{math}
:label: 2power
abundance_{raw} = 2^(log_{2}abundance_{transformed})
```
